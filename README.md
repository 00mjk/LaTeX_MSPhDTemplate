  2. Facility to accommodate up to four advisory committee members

Page Numbers in Table of Contents (List of Figures, List of Tables and Index as well), Table/Figure/Bibliography references are all hyperlinks
With double sided printing, it automatically inserts a blank page (if necessary) to start the new chapter on an odd numbered page
Appropriate margins for single/double sided printing
Fonts are embedded – the PDF looks the same when printed as it looks when it’s viewed on computer 
Many other features that one can learn about by reading the corresponding style files
If using Linux/UNIX or may be even Mac, the entire process of compiling/processing and generating PDF could be as simple as typing make – more information about this magical make is in a subsequent section
May even save you a few extra nights of sleep that you would have otherwise spent in making these things work by yourself
